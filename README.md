# Scaled Dragon Fight 🌠

A lightweight **server-side Fabric mod** that dynamically scales the **Ender Dragon's** health based on the number of players in The End — now with support for **delayed initial spawns** and XP bar countdowns.

No installation is needed on the client — just drop it into your server's `mods` folder and configure it to your liking.

## 🔧 Features

- 📈 **Dynamic Health Scaling:** The Ender Dragon's max health increases with each eligible player in The End.
- ⏱️ **Initial Spawn Delay:** Optionally delay the very first dragon spawn and show a countdown on players’ XP bars.
- ⚙️ **Server-Side Only:** No client installation required — perfect for modded or vanilla-compatible SMPs.
- 🔧 **Configurable:** Customize how scaling and spawn delays work via a simple `.properties` config file.
- 📢 **Broadcast Messages:** Optional announcements when a scaled dragon appears.
- 🛠️ **In-Game Reload:** `/scaleddragonfight reload` command to reload configuration without restarting the server.
